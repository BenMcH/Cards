# Cards
This is the new version of our cards framework based out of libgdx
Myself, along with help from [SeductiveJelly](https://github.com/SeductiveJelly), have been changing our [Card Framework](https://github.com/tycoon177/Cards-Framework) into a state of using libgdx as opposed to rolling our own code.
